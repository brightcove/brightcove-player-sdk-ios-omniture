# Omniture (Adobe Marketing Cloud - Adobe Analytics) Plugin for Brightcove Player SDK for iOS, version 7.0.9.47

## Installation

The Omniture plugin is a dynamic library framework which supports Adobe Marketing Cloud v4.21.2 and Adobe Video Heartbeat v2.3.0. The Marketing Cloud and Video Heartbeat libraries **are not** included with this SDK and must be manually added to your project. Instructions for downloading the libraries are provided below.

### CocoaPods

You can use [CocoaPods][cocoapods] to add the Omniture plugin to your project.  You can find the latest `Brightcove-Player-Omniture` podspec [here][podspecs]. To use this spec, add the following to the top of your Podfile: `source 'https://github.com/brightcove/BCOVSpecs.git'`.

#### Dynamic XCFramework example:

```bash
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs'
source 'https://github.com/brightcove/BrightcoveSpecs.git'

platform :ios, '12.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'MyOmniturePlayer' do
  pod 'Brightcove-Player-Omniture'
end
```

#### Framework example:

Frameworks can be installed by appending the `/Framework` subspec to the pod name.

```bash
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs'
source 'https://github.com/brightcove/BrightcoveSpecs.git'

platform :ios, '12.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'MyOmniturePlayer' do
  pod 'Brightcove-Player-Omniture/Framework'
end
```

### Manual

To add the Omniture Plugin for Brightcove Player SDK to your project manually:

1. Install the latest version of the [Brightcove Player SDK][bcovsdkmanualsetup].
2. Download the latest zip'ed release of the plugin from the [release page][release].
1. Add the `BrightcoveAMC.framework` or `BrightcoveAMC.xcframework` project.  You can do this by right-clicking on the Frameworks folder and choose "Add Files To" option and select the `BrightcoveAMC.framework` or `BrightcoveAMC.xcframework` from the path where it is stored.
1. On the "Build Settings" tab of your application target, ensure that the "Framework Search Paths" include the path to the framework. This should have been done automatically unless the framework is stored under a different root directory than your project.
1. On the "Build Phases" tab of your application target, add the following to the "Link
    Binary With Libraries" phase:
    * `BrightcoveAMC.framework` / `BrightcoveAMC.xcframework`
1. On the "Build Settings" tab of your application target:
    * Ensure that `-ObjC` has been added to the "Other Linker Flags" build setting.
1. Download Adobe Marketing Cloud following Adobe's [instructions][adobemarketingcloud] and add `AdobeMobile.xcframework` to your project.
1. Download Adobe Video Heartbeat following Adobe's [instructions][adobevideoheartbeat] and add `MediaSDK.xcframework` to your project.
1. Add the Marketing Cloud and Video Heartbeat header folders to the Header Search Path settings of your project.
1. (**Universal Framework** only) On the "Build Phases" tab, add a "Run Script" phase with the command `bash ${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/${FRAMEWORKS_FOLDER_PATH}/BrightcoveAMC.framework/strip-frameworks.sh`. Check "Run script only when installing". This will remove unneeded architectures from the build, which is important for App Store submission.
1. (**Apple Silicon** only) On the "Build Settings" tab of your application target:
    * Ensure that `arm64` has been added to your "Excluded Architectures" build setting for `Any iOS Simulator SDK`.

## Quick Start

BrightcoveAMC is a bridge between the [Brightcove Player SDK for iOS][bcovsdk] and Adobe video tracking, including [Adobe Video Heartbeat v2][adobevideoheartbeat] and [Adobe Media Tracking v4][adobemobileservice]. BrightcoveAMC tracks basic video behaviors: video ready, video completed, video play, and video pause. 

## Client Implementation

To setup Adobe Video Heartbeat, Omniture Plugin clients need to implement instances of BCOVAMCVideoHeartbeatConfigurationPolicy. To setup Adobe Media Tracking, an instance of BCOVAMCMediaSettingPolicy is required. These [policies][strategypattern] allow for customization of ADBMediaHeartbeatConfig or ADBMediaSettings objects for each playback session.

[strategypattern]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern

### Video Heartbeat v2

This example uses video heartbeat tracking.

```swift
[1] // Create the VHB configuration policy object.
    let videoHeartbeatConfigurationPolicy: BCOVAMCVideoHeartbeatConfigurationPolicy = {
        (session: BCOVPlaybackSession?) in

        let configData = ADBMediaHeartbeatConfig()

        configData.trackingServer = "<adobe-assigned_tracking_server>"
        configData.channel = "<cutomize_sample_channel>"
        configData.appVersion = "<app_version>"
        configData.ovp = "<online_video_platform>"
        configData.playerName = "<player_name>"
        configData.ssl = false

        // Set debugLogging to true to activate debug tracing. Remove it in production.
        configData.debugLogging = true

        return configData
    }

[2] // Create the Brightcove AMC analytics policy object fromw1w the VHB configuration policy object.
    let heartbeatPolicy = BCOVAMCAnalyticsPolicy(heartbeatConfigurationPolicy: videoHeartbeatConfigurationPolicy)

    let sessionConsumer = BCOVAMCSessionConsumer.heartbeatAnalyticsConsumer(with: heartbeatPolicy, delegate: self)

    let sdkManager = BCOVPlayerSDKManager.sharedManager()
    let playbackController = sdkManager.createPlaybackController()
    playbackController.delegate = self

    videoView.addSubview(playerView)

[3] // Add the Brightcove AMC session consumer to the playback controller.
    playbackController.add(sessionConsumer)

[4] // Find and play a video.
    let policyKey = "<your-policy-key>"
    let accountID = "<your-account-id>"
    let videoID = "<your-video-id>"
    let playbackService = BCOVPlaybackService(withAccountId: accountID,
                                              policyKey: policyKey)
    let configuration = [
        BCOVPlaybackService.ConfigurationKeyAssetID: videoID
    ]
    playbackService.findVideo(withConfiguration: configuration,
                              queryParameters: nil) { (video: BCOVVideo?,
                                                       jsonResponse: Any?,
                                                       error: Error?) in
        if let video {
            playbackController.setVideos([video])
            playbackController.play()
        }
    }
```
       
1. Create the video heartbeat configuration policy block which will be called at the start of each playback session. The policy allows for customization of configuration data based on the current session.
1. Use the configuration policy block to create and initialize a BCOVAMCAnalyticsPolicy instance with `BCOVAMCAnalyticsPolicy(heartbeatConfigurationPolicy:)`. The BCOVAMCAnalyticsPolicy object is used to create the BCOVAMCSessionConsumer.
1. After the playback controller is created, call the add session consumer method, `playbackController.add()`, to add the AMC session consumer.

### Marketing Cloud

This example uses media tracking.

```swift
[1] let mediaSettingPolicy: BCOVAMCMediaSettingPolicy = { (session: BCOVPlaybackSession?) in
[2]     let settings = ADBMobile.mediaCreateSettings(withName: "<cutomize_setting_name>",
                                                     length: 0,
                                                     playerName: "<cutomize_player_name>",
                                                     playerID: "<cutomize_player_ID>")
[3]     settings.milestones = "25,50,75"; // a customization.
        return settings
    }
[4] let mediaPolicy = BCOVAMCAnalyticsPolicy(mediaSettingsPolicy: mediaSettingPolicy)

    let sessionConsumer = BCOVAMCSessionConsumer.mediaAnalyticsConsumer(with: mediaPolicy,
                                                                        delegate: self)

    let sdkManager = BCOVPlayerSDKManager.sharedManager()
[5] let playbackController = sdkManager.createPlaybackController()
    playbackController.delegate = self

    videoView.addSubview(playerView)

    // Add the Brightcove AMC session consumer to the playback controller.
    playbackController.add(sessionConsumer)

    // Find and play a video.
    let policyKey = "<your-policy-key>"
    let accountID = "<your-account-id>"
    let videoID = "<your-video-id>"
    let playbackService = BCOVPlaybackService(withAccountId: accountID,
                                              policyKey: policyKey)
    let configuration = [
        BCOVPlaybackService.ConfigurationKeyAssetID: videoID
    ]
    playbackService.findVideo(withConfiguration: configuration,
                              queryParameters: nil) { (video: BCOVVideo?,
                                                       jsonResponse: Any?,
                                                       error: Error?) in
        if let video {
            playbackController.setVideos([video])
            playbackController.play()
        }
    }
```

1. Create the media settings policy block which will be called at the start of each playback session. The policy allows for customization of media settings based on the current session.
1. When creating the ADBMediaSettings instance with a class method of ADBMobile `mediaCreateSettings(withName:length:playerName:playerID:)`, you can set **video length** to **0**. The Omniture plugin will update it later.
1. Add optional settings such as milestones. 
1. Use the media settings policy block to create and initialize a BCOVAMCAnalyticsPolicy instance with `BCOVAMCAnalyticsPolicy(mediaSettingsPolicy:)`. The policy object is used to create an AMC session consumer for Adobe media tracking as `BCOVAMCSessionConsumer.mediaAnalyticsConsumer(with:delegate:)`.
1. After the playback controller is created, call the add session consumer method, `playbackController.add()`, to add the AMC session consumer.
